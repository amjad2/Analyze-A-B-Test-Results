# Analyze-A-B-Test-Results

I used A/B testing in python to help the company understand if they should implement the new page or keep the old page using Pandas, Numpys, and Matplotlib. 

I performed A/B testing  using three methods: 
1- Manually performed using a loop to simulate 10,000 experiments using numpy.random.choice() function.
2- Z-test using sm.stats.proportions_ztest function.
3- Use StatsModel package to run the logistic regression model.

Finally, I interpreted the results with practical reasoning and help the company to make their decision.
